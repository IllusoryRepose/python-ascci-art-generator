# python-ascci-art-generator

Yo fam 👋 this lil project turns your boring pics into some dope **ASCII art**.  
Like, you throw an image in and boom – it's a bunch of characters looking all artsy n’ stuff.  

## 🚀 How to run it:
1. Clone this repo (duh).
2. Install the stuff you need:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   
# Run it like this:
python ASCIIart.py path/to/your/image.png

# Example:
Input: your pic of a cat 🐱
Output: same cat but in ASCII, looking hella cool in your terminal.
